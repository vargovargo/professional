Since coming to UW in September 2012, Jason has been a unifying force for campus research, education, and action on cities. Early on, Dr. Vargo was integrated into large multi-disciplinary grant proposals to the National Science Foundation and US Environmental Protection Agency. At the same time he has continued to pursue his own research, publishing work on climate change in urban areas ([1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargo_JEM_2013.pdf), [2](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Climate%20change%20adaptation%20through%20urban%20heat%20management_ES&T.pdf), [3](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Stone_2014.pdf), [4](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/co-author/HabeebNaturalHazards2015.pdf), [5](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/ugec_viewpointsJuly2013_vargo.pdf)), with several related papers in preparation or currently under review ([6](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargoLiuXiao_MS.pdf), [7](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/JPER_submission_5-15.pdf)). Vargo also contributed a chapter on healthy and sustainable built environments to the forthcoming book Climate Change and Public Health ([8](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/BookChapters/CC_health14_Proof.pdf)).
