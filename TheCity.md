		___TITLE___

#Outline#

In presenting the city as a place with you today I want to cover three points that can guide our discussion to follow. 

1. Cities __IN__ the environment: The connections between activities in cities and the natural systems within which they set. Can cities be supportive of ecological function?

2. Cities __AS__ environment: The city as human habitat and as a key determinant of individual and community health as well as environmental impact. 

3. Cities and __OUR NATURE__: cities simultaneously hold a unique place in our individual and collective psyches that makes them ideal spatial and political units of action on the most pressing global problems we as humans face.

#1. The City in Environment#
###The City is a place connected to other places and people well outside its municipal, political, and physical boundaries.###

		___FARM___

Though the phrase is synonymous with a bucolic rural life, “living off the land” is equally applicable to cities. A crucial difference is in scale and reach. Cities are critical for thinking about global sustainability because cities rely on resources well beyond their physical borders. Even within cities self-sufficient living (think of gardens fed by rain barrels in the backyards of houses covered by solar panels) is commonly mistaken for being sustainable, but in today’s globalized world virtually nothing at a local scale is self-sufficient (think of the building materials for the home, or the bikes the residents use to get around). 

		___PIPELINE___

An almost universal characteristic of urbanism is that the resources and materials on which we survive come from places other than where we live. 

		___TIRES___

Conversely, the wastes produced within cities do not sit on our (literal) doorsteps in perpetuity.  

		___INVERSION___

Impacts of cities extend to the crop selection on argicultural landscapes, and the quality of our water and air sheds.

		___ATLANTA___

Cursory logic of the city can lead to false presumptions around the city's impact on ecological disturbance, resource consumption, and pollution. Part of this recognizing these connections will require describing the influence urban-ness on environmental impact. 

		___SPRAWL___

### The Urban Advantage###

_The arrangement of people into more urban places can be effective strategies to cap environment impacts._

		___JEM___

Questions of the connections between urban organization (spatial) and environmental impacts help demonstrate the comparative per capita urban advantages. (* In a study we published in 2013 we found much of the growth in Atlanta to follow the suburban patter. And expected that if half of the suburban population growth during the study period had been added following a more urban pattern of development, over 77 square miles (about 50,000 acres) of forests may have been preserved the equivalent of 20 percent of the total forest lost during the decade.*) For example, which arrangements lessen impacts on energy use, water consumption, and waste production? And subsequently, how are these arrangements prioritized as energy policies? 

		___LA___

In addition to land consumption, there is now evidence that urban-ness reduces per-capita energy consumption. Compact urban centers can help decrease per-capita GHG emissions. Less urban areas typically have larger homes and more cars. The average energy use among homes with increasing density -- single-family detached, single-family attached, and multi-family -- demonstrates these benefits.  They require people to drive longer distances than residents of compact developments and urban centers. 

		___GRAPH___

Moving a household from a less-dense suburban area to a more-dense urban area reduces energy use -- more than technological improvements can achieve. For the average household in the United States, moving from a traditional suburb to an urban location (with technological improvements) could [reduce energy use by 75 percent](http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/location_efficiency_BTU.htm).

Infrastructure investments, such as those for sewers and roads, are considerable expenses for municipalities. Density around these investments makes them operationally efficient and can increase tax revenues to make them affordable. Cities are crucial demand-side strategies for ensuring that technological solutions (on the supply side) work.

#2. The City as Environment

### The City is the place we spend most of our days and nights, it shapes our behavior, exposures, and interactions. ###

Behavior represents the interaction of the person and the environment.

This involves examining the city as the environment we inhabit and interact with on a daily basis: connections with ourselves.   The urban environment shapes our behaviors. The environment, and its impact on our behavior are largely responsible for our overall health, yet receive little attention and direct investment.  (*[environment and behavior account for more than 70% of health determinants but less than 10% of all health expenditures](http://www.nehi.net/writable/publication_files/file/boston_paradox_onepager_2008.pdf)*)

The built environment can limit or provide opportunities for a healthy and social life.

		___BOGOTA___

Active transportation is one aspect of daily behavior I have worked on a lot. Bogota, Colombia has been lauded for its investment in transportation modes like transit, walking and cycling. Building transportation infrastructure for people without cars is a safety issue, a health issue and an equity issue for cities. 

		___AHA___

Policy plays an important role in shaping the places we live. The American Housing Authorities revised plans for subdivisions limited connectivity, which required driving, and funneled cars to high volume, high speed, high danger roads. 

		___DOLORES___

Contact with nature, encouraging human interactions, and limiting exposures to pollution are other health concerns that the built environment can begin to address. 

		___CLOVER___

Decisions of the built environment can be lasting and dramatic. They can severely restrict activities that we know are good for individuals and communities. In some cases as with highway systems, these decisions have been used to drive communities apart as part of larger legacies of racial injustice. 

	___BLANK___

First, as was discussed, the built environment can limit or present the choices for wellbeing. Secondly, the built environment should behigh quality and appealing enough so that it encourages the healthy activities. 

		___MCDONALDS___

In many places, the design and construction of built environments has been generally adapted for automobiles, rather than people. This is apparent in the size of storefront signs corresponds to the width of adjacent roads and the speed of the traffic. Signs in older, traditional business districts, where there is regular pedestrian traffic, are much smaller than those set back from the road and read by drivers traveling at 55 miles per hour. Human-centered design accommodates life for people -- not cars. The resultant built environment is usually of higher quality and more enjoyable, and yields lower GHG emissions. 

		___RACINE___

The details of urban design are crucial to ensuring that changes in the urban environment promote health co-benefits.  Design of physical environments must consider density, proximity, and connectivity and make places safe and attractive in order to encourage social and other activities. A [high-quality physical environment that provides human-centered spaces for people](http://www.citiesforpeople.ca/en), away from noise, dirt, and traffic, can dramatically increase optional outdoor activities and, in turn, invite more social interaction. Details are important. 

		___BLANK___

Particularly in the US, the built environments that many of us call home tend to encourage resource consumption and unhealthy behaviors. However, as sites of rapid and intentional change, __cities__ present incredible opportunities to improve lives and correct past mistakes.

#3. The City as Part of our Nature

		___LIGHTS___

Interestingly they would cease to exist without us.  The city is an emergent phenomenon of human social interaction.  

###Part of our Psyche

		___CHICAGO___

Though we have city planners, few -- in not some of the most suspect -- cities were the idea a single person or even group of people. Famous city plans such as Burnham's Chicago, L'Enfant's DC, or Haussman's Paris help organize the city, not make it so in the first place. 

		___ATL___

As a place -- the city is where most of us live. However, the local character and associations we have with the city where we live help define who we are and expand the boundaries of self.  The city is a place and is made up of places that are embraced and experienced in intimate ways. We personalize the city as our own place (picking our favorite spots of escape or finding a local haunt and making it our own). 

		___WEIRD___

We take on the persona of our cities and see ourselves as informing it (Keep Austin Weird). And there is no limit to the number top (or bottom) 25 lists we'll click on to see how our city stacks up against others. The emotional associations people have with their city(s), could be important for stimulating local and sustained action to improve the places we live. This is something obvious in campaigns to support local businesses. 

		___BLANK___

So while at the same time cities affect individual identity, urbanism (in one form or another) is shared by more people than at any point in history, and this statement will be true to a new degree by the time we leave this room today. 

###Future Growth###

		___OLDNYC___

+ 10,000 - the number of years ago we began organizing into cities. 

+ 3.5 Billion - The number of urban residents on earth after 100 centuries of the practice

Using the 2008 milestone (*50%*) to discuss global urbanization gives us a touchstone for where we, as a species, are on this trajectory, but does not provide any guidance about potential actions to change it. 

		___TOKYO___

+ 5 Billion - the number of new urban residents expected in the next century (60M/yr  OR  1+M every week)

		___MENDOZA___

+ Combined with this population growth there is a tendency toward decreasing density (about half)

		___COLOMBIA___

+ The amount of urbanization that took place between Mesopotamia and now will happen again by 2060
	
		___AJAY___	

Whether or not cities can exist without leading to catastrophic environmental degradation is an interesting question that deserves serious attention, thought, and creativity. Whether or not we should be moving to cities is not. 

			___FAVELA___

Our long-term commitment to living in cities is inherent. 

		___EVOLUTION___

The human inclination toward cities is indisputable. It is one of the most reliable trends of the last 5,000 years (population growth being the only more reliable trend). We are, today an urban species, and the city is our habitat. 

		___VANCOUVER___

Is this the central cause of energy overuse and exploitation or can it be one of the keys to reigning in global environmental change (or at least coping with it)?  We are faced with a challenge to resolve our __domesticated tendencies and terrestrial dependancies__. 

A fundamental aim of sustainability is to preserve the existence of our species; it is clear that we will need to embrace urbanism as a human quality to achieve that end.

#Appendix: Definitions#
*this comes largely from the Introduction to William Meyer's book "[The Environmental Advantages of Cities](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/environmental-advantages-cities)"*

What is a city? What is urban? 

The terms *city* and *urban* are widely used but not standaradized. In part, this may be due to the wide diversity of academic fields which study cities -- they are not the principal field of study for any subject, but are included in many. The context in which the terms are used and applied matters greatly. It is not surprising that with no standard definitions and common usage, severl misconceptions about global urbaniaztion have been able to spread. Common myths [via David Satterhwaite](http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/54031/1/63650977X.pdf):

>Urban growth will take place cheifly in megacities

>Urbanization in the less developed countries is "out of control"

> Rapidly growing cities are a phenomenon exclusively of the LDCs

For the purposes of this dicussion I would like to familiarize the audience with some of the more rigorous definitions of the terms that are used and mention some of their merits. 

###City###

> Large number of people living together in a __relatively__ small area

> High populations by themselves are not enough (ie China and India)

> High density is not even enough (!Kung Bushmen)

> High density ___AND___ large population are required

> The test of density is a __relative__ one

These three traits of a city trace back to population and density

> Chief industry other than agriculture

> Functional unity -- in place name and political identity

> "A transformation of the physical environment to a built environment."

>> "the degree to which a surface is occupied by structures and artifacts of plainly human shaping."

###Urban####

Many definitions put a place in (or out) of an urban category

> Census uses cutoffs

> UN has no standard definition

> Many statistics use a basis of incorporated local political divisions 

> Remote sensing methods are well suited to distinguish more from less urban areas on the basis of built-environment criteria

When really we would do much better to think in terms of degrees of qualities
> This implies urbaness as a continuum rather than a dichotomy

>> There are several pitfalls to using the urban-rural dichotomy

> Thus, 'City' "becomes a convenient shorthand for a place that has a high degree of urban-ness

>>In Peter Calthorpe's [Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change](http://islandpress.org/urbanism-age-climate-change) urbanism is defined by "*qualities, not quantities; by diversity, not size; by intensity, not density; by connectivity, not just location.*"

> Social, political, or cultural stereotypes associated with urban and rural have been dissolving and should not be considered part of the term

>> Importantly, affluence shows no consistent direction in its relationship with urbaness

> Urban-ness varies between cities and regions as well as within them

>> Common terms like suburban demostrate the recognition of this as places with lower population densities, less elaborate units of government, and land cover not dominated by built structures

> The verb "*urbanize*" ought to mean move toward a higher degree of urbaness

>> This charaterizes urbanization as a process, rather than a pattern

>>> Interestingly the two charateristics operate inversely of one another

Urban-ness should be viewed as a suite of technologies that has changed over time and place. The best parts of this suite can be adopted widely and adapted to fit different contexts. 

Independent of these definitions of urban, the word carries embedded meanings that are culturally understood and which change over time. The meaning for a particular people or region will vary depending on the stage of development, the racial structure, and city history in the place. In some cases the urban advantage is dominant. This is common for many cities outside of the US, where central downtown areas exhibit the higest degree of urbanism and have high conentrations of wealth. In the US, more urban places were historically portrayed as properous, sometimes featuring billowing smokestacks on postcards marketed to tourists. Eventually the *urban penalty* of factory pollution and/or crowded tenaments changed the reputation of urban America. In many American cities, racial associaitons of denser downtowns and fringe suburbs helped fuel large-scale suburbanization and defined perceptions of 'urban' areas.
