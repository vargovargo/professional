##COMMITMENT TO CYCLING##

My support for cycling is based in two motivating interests: first I want better places for people to live, and second I want to promote healthy lifestyles. I am committed to advocating for cycling’s role in creating quality places to live by improving mobility, equality, and society.  I value cycling, whether for commuting or recreation, as an important way for the people of Wisconsin to improve their physical and mental health through increased activity and interaction. 

Overwhelmingly, both in terms of the proportion of my commutes that are by bicycle and the fraction of my rides that are utilitarian, I am a bicycle commuter. Since 2003, biking has been a primary means of commuting for me.  Since moving to Madison in September 2012, I have been biking more for trips outside of getting to work, including trips to take my kids to school and runs to the store. 

Between May and October this year [I rode 1,200 miles](https://nationalbikechallenge.org/rider/10193), and most of my riding consisted of short trips to and from locations. I also seek out ways to use bikes even when I am away from home. Over the course of the 6 months I rode a bike on nearly 60% of the days, this meant cycling when summer trips took me to new places, including using bike share to cover nearly 30 miles on a weekend trip to Chicago in August.  I am committed to the bicycle as a primary means of transportation, a great way to experience a new place, and an accessible and affordable transportation option for people of all ages. 


##KNOWLEDGE OF CONCERNS AND ABILITY TO CRAFT SOLUTIONS##

One of the first interactions I had with Madison – its government, culture, and politics – was attending a public meeting on the prospect of new lighting on the Southwest Commuter Path. I discussed my [reflections in a blog post](http://vargocity.blogspot.com/2013/01/nimby-madsion.html). I have used my blog to cover and describe many biking issues including bike helmet design, use, and promotion, as well as the shortcomings and merits of Walkscore.com’s Bike Score for Madison neighborhoods. On a larger platform, I have written for Huffington Post regarding effort’s of municipal governments in India to [restrict cycling in the city of Kolkata](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-vargo/kolkata-bike-ban_b_4157234.html). 

In a professional capacity, I have consistently found ways to connect my position with cycling concerns. As a member of the air quality branch in Georgia DOT’s Planning Division (2004-2005), I helped transportation demand management organizations create incentives for active commuting and worked closely with the Division’s Bike and Pedestrian Coordinator on policy and funding issues for cycling. This position also allowed me to receive training on road design strategies for traffic calming.  

Socially I engage with the cycling community though various avenues, including my membership to the WI Bike Fed and less formally, the Bikies’ listserve.  At the same time, I remain aware and interested in the progress of former associations like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition. Podcasts like Portland’s ‘Bike Portland Podcast’ and social media continue to introduce me to emerging cyclist concerns and solutions. Examples of issues that I’ve been turned onto recently include persistent issues like mandating lights or helmets and more timely concerns related to the recent Governor’s Highway Safety Administration report. 


##SERVICE EXPERIENCE AS A LEADER FOR NON-PROFIT##

My involvement with the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition was highlighted as a leader in helping to make Atlanta’s first ‘ciclovia’ events a reality. During research for my masters degrees in public health and urban planning, I studied for two months in Bogota, Colombia – the place where Ciclovia originated. My connection to Bogotá and researchers at Atlanta’s Center for Disease Control studying the public health benefits of active transport made me an asset in the initial planning.  Following my involvement in the initial planning, I served as the volunteer coordinator for the first two events in 2011. The events, called Atlanta Streets Alive, received broad interest across the city and have continued to grow and expand to new parts of the city. Our first event attracted an estimated 6,000 participants onto one mile of closed streets. I am happy to see that the program has continued to gain momentum and their most recent event, this September, [attracted an estimated 100,000 people](http://www.atlantastreetsalive.com/). 

I have recently been asked to serve on the board of a small non-profit – [Safe Roads to Health](http://www.saferoadstohealth.org/) – founded by a Madison transportation engineer. The goal of the organization is to improve traffic safety, beginning with her native Ethiopia. The World Health Organization has identified road safety as an important area of focus for the next decade. I have been fortunate to travel to Ethiopia in recent years to meet with officials on how urbanization can take place while encouraging cycling and improving safety. If selected as a Bike Fed Board Member I hope that my involvement with the two organizations will produce ways for both to benefit from each other. 


##MEMBERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION IN WI BIKE FED ACTIVITIES##

I am currently a member of the Wisconsin Bike Fed and while living in Atlanta (2004-2012) I was an active member of the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition. As a member of the organization I participated in a number of events. Sometimes as a volunteer for parking bike at large events and in leadership roles for the Atlanta Streets Alive events. 

With the WI Bike Fed I have been primarily involved in a participatory role, attending events with Bike Fed representation and sponsorship. During my two years in Wisconsin, I have sought other ways to support the many bike organizations here. I am an active B-cycler and even contributed the design that was selected for their 2014 t-shirts. For the last two years I have also been involved with the popular Bike-the Barns Events, serving as ride support. Also with the Campus Police I’ve distributed free bike lights as part of the ‘Be Bright’ campaign for the last two years.  

I see being involved with the many cycling interests in the state as something I am naturally drawn to, as well as a part of my life in WI that I would like to expand should I serve as a Bike Fed Board Member. 

##PROFESSIONAL LEVEL SKILLS##

As a planner, then as a student, and now as a scientist, my focus has been on the built environment and public health. This involves obtaining, discerning, and interpreting metrics for quantifying the built environment, including the land use and infrastructure patterns that support active transportation.  In addition to research, my teaching has also focused on the connections between cycling and health, safety, and quality of life. 

As an intern at Georgia Tech’s Center for Quality Growth and Regional Development I worked on the [Active Transportation Plan for Decatur, GA](http://www.cqgrd.gatech.edu/research/city-of-decatur-ga-community-transportation-plan-and-rapid-hia). This involved organizing and moderating sessions of public meetings as well as performing a Latent Demand Survey for planning future cycling infrastructure investments. Since its completion, Decatur’s Active Transportation Plan  has been held up as a model for the region. 

An important part of my work has been making and fostering connections to other scientists and advocates in this arena. My network of active transportation, planning, and public health contacts could be an asset for cycling advocacy. 


##PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER## 

I see building mutually supportive relationships as key to personal and profession satisfaction. At work, I seek to make projects better and help my colleagues do their best. I’ve done this by first sharing skills. In every work setting I’ve been a part of I have found ways to share my skills with co-workers in ways they’ve found beneficial. As a post-doctoral scholar at UW’s Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, I started a weekly lunch meeting for staff to share a skill of their own with co-workers. The results expanded the capacity of many workers and encouraged collaboration. Trust building is inherent in this type of knowledge exchange, and the whole organization is made stronger.

##ABILITY TO FUNDRAISE##

Fundraising is essentially part of my job now. Like many researchers my salary is partially based on the ability of my ideas and work to attract funding through grants. I see grant writing for research as a skill that is transferable to fundraising. Additionally, in my current role at the University of Wisconsin with the Global Health Institute I have been more directly involved with campaigns to attract private funding from large donors. This experience has been invaluable for thinking about where and how fundraising takes place.  I look forward to the opportunity to pursue new paths of support for WI Bike Fed through either of these modes.
