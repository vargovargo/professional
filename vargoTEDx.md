#Our Urban Nature#
What was the first domesticated animal? 

What if the answer is US?  What if domestication -- settlement, society, even cities are part of our evolution as humans? Part of what makes us human?

Darwin was one of the first to suggest that we showed some physical signs of domestication. Behaviorally, evolutionary scientists suggest, we benefited from working together and that social ties became more important to survival. 

It’s not a realization that’s so easy to swallow. And, as a recent Science article on the topic pointed out, we don’t like to think of ourselves as ‘tame’.

---------------------------------

And yet, it is probably the source for some of the most amazing advances in our species’ existence. 

Eventually domestication led to us exhibit a tendency to settle and stay in one place. One feature of our brains that is most amazing is their ability to envision situations and circumstances that we’re not actually experiencing. We can put ourselves in other people’s shoes. And at some point we began to think about the future. Our understanding of how actions in the present could be connected to outcomes down the road is another reason we began to settle. We began to make the most of the land and other human resources around us and we invested time in making place. 

>>At some point when we envisioned the future, we began to stay put. Maybe we choose the people with us, maybe they choose us, but we settled in places, often with other people and we began to think more strategically about how best to use the resources of the place and people where we were. 

For 10,000 years we’ve been living in settlements. And for just as long we’ve been taking advantage of their benefits. They are the same benefits we talk about today when we talk about cities – exchange of ideas, goods, specialization.

"For the human, the combination of adoption of a built environment, change in diet consistency, and lowered mobility brought about morphological changes similar to those seen in certain domestic animals."

>>The timeline of urbanism helps us understand a bit more about what our future could be and the role cities could play in it.

Looking at a history of our development and settlement we see a trend of continually increasing settlement into, what today we would refer to as cities. 

And we see that massive and lasting innovations are coupled with that urban movement.  

The first cities helped develop agriculture, accrued wealth and resources and eventually even stores of food. 

Things we never intended to create, but which are still with us today, government, writing, and trade emerged in response. 

In the last 2000 years we see some of the cities we’re most familiar with and start to see some of the city planning touchstones that I learned about in graduate school.  But the trend toward urban living has been a long time coming, and today it is taking off. 

>>The first settlements were coincident to the development of agriculture and livestock. Then we see evidence of cities like Jericho and eventually the development of administrative units and more investment in staying and protecting a place (with the invention of the walled city). Specialization of tasks in the cities helps develop food surpluses and we see the first evidence of writing (necessary for keeping records). Next cities appear in Crete and China. Regular trade is established between cities. The cities of Rome and Alexandria get thier starts. Moving to BC, Rome reaches its prominance and serves as a world and historic touchstone for culture, art, technology, wealth, and power. 

>>As we come into the modern age, we begin to see cities and city form we're more familiar with. The modern global hubs of trade and finance emerge. With the the industrial revolutions and mechanization of all manner of tasks. The size, variety, and spread of cities as we most often think of them is a blip on our whole urban history. And it is easy to see that this blip coincides with unprecedented growth in the number of people living in cities. 

If we look at the number of ‘urban dwellers’ we see tremendous growth over the last 300 years and we often hear that today half of the world’s population lives in cities. 3.5 billion people.  

The spike in the urban population coincides with a couple other important trends that I am interested in from an environmental and health perspective. You may be familiar with climate change’s infamous hockey stick graph. It depicts atmospheric concentrations of green house gases and shows the massive impact that human use of fossil fuels is having. Recent growth parallels global environmental issues, and the scariest part is that the next century is forecast to be the most urban yet. It took us 100 centuries to reach 3.5 billion now and we’re expected add 5 billion in the next 100 years (century). 

As we talk today about designing change, it’s important to know that all of the development that has taken place from Mesopotamia til now will be equaled by urban development in the next 50 years. That means not only new cities, but rebuilding the places we already have.  

With that much construction and place making yet to happen, decisions around and in urban places do not have to lead us to collapse. They can be take us in a completely different direction.

--------------
What should future settlements look like?
Can 7 billion people live like this?

Dividing all the arable land on the planet up yields about 4 tenths of an acre per person, that’s a little more than an acre and a half for a family of four. Which may sound like a lot at first. 

But consider that under this scenario, everyone is on their own for food. There is not much space left for offices, stores, let alone much room for things like biodiversity. Not likely to happen

--------------
The American model of land consumption and separation of land uses is also not likely survive. 

In his [manifesto for an urban America](http://www.archdaily.com/430538/a-country-of-cities-a-manifesto-for-an-urban-america/), Vishaan Chakrabarti calls the suburb, America’s most dangerous export. The form is becoming attractive in many other parts of the world, perhaps because it is highly subsidized. Yet it underperforms when compared to more urban settings on almost every measure. 

Real urbanism calls for diversity not just size. 

-------------
Density by itself is not urbanism. The characteristics that make this a slum (limited access to water and sanitation, lack of secure tenure, poor housing quality) are not innate to being urban. 

---------
We need new models of urban living.

At one level that means places must be well thought out, attractive and empowering – that means human-scale, high quality, and context specific with enabling governance and civic processes

On a larger scale, cities must understand and embrace their relationships to natural material and energy inputs and environmental quality.  

Can cities  be supportive of surrounding and connected environments and species, while providing basic levels of quality for all?

If so, then working to create great urban lives may be the way forward for ensuring quality lives for future generations.

--------
How can we truly embrace urbanism as part of being human and what benefits would it offer?

It would be easy to look at the two and to think urban living is the source of our global environmental problems, but it doesn’t have to be.  I believe that being mindful of our urban nature can actually be the key to helping us solve some of the problems we face. 

----------

The first thing we need is to redefine the relationship of urban and the environment. Historically cities have reinforced the dominance of man over nature.

----------

What do I mean by urbanism? I mean degrees of urbanism where intensity proximity connectedness diversity increase as you move to the right.

----------

Energy use and pollution. Per capita carbon. Unlikely suburbs can exist as 2/3 of population

----------

Talking the elevator to ground you'll be able to walk to twice the number of store in an urban layout

----------

One powerful aspect of urban design is it can have impact on behaviors as modified environments. Cities influence our behavior. Even people who preferred to live in single family housing but lived in an urban layout walked more than those who lived in single famy homes

----------

Data on how our brains have evolved to function more effecently with higher degrees of urbanism. Here participants were given a task of choosing which mailbox was closer. Participants were more quickly able to make the correct decision in the more connected hypothetical setting perhaps suggesting that the same environmental advantage would prefer existence in an urban setting.

----------

So you know what I'm going to say next... No we should not build cities on the moon.
