What was the first domesticated animal? Dog? Goat?

Us. 

Charles Darwin even suggested that humans have been showing signs of domestication for a long time. He described the retnetion of useless organs like our extrinsic ear muscles (or appendices). Others have described changes in body type and stature; citing the effects of the built environment. Surely the move to settlements instituted some dramatic social developments in our species' history.

"For the human, the combination of adoption of a built environment, change in diet consistency, and lowered mobility brought about morphological changes similar to those seen in certain domestic animals."

Today I want to talk about our urban nature as humans,  I want to take us through some of that history in order to help us understand a bit more about what our future could be and the role cities could play in it. 


If you just moved from this to this, have you urbanized?

Being an urban species means cities are habitat. Most people will ask we what cities have to do with global health, particularly if I am working with cities here in the US. To me cities 


<!--- "One of the few advantages of age, when you talk about the future is that you've already been there so many times." [Nicholas Negroponte](http://www.npr.org/2013/08/26/215826949/predicting-the-future) ---> 

The form and function of our cities has evolved over time as well. Lewis Mumford described this evolution as embodying 

>_"a tendency to loosen the bonds that connect [the city's] inhabitants with nature and to transform, eliminate, or replace its earth-bound aspects, covering the natural site with an artificial environment that enhances the dominance of man and encourages an illusion of complete independence from nature"_

Increasinglyt eh dominant city form of the day has relied more and more on resources and materials from further and furhter beyond its own boundaries. 

>_"The task of environmental design in its most profound sense, therefore, is to understand the trends and make the most of the opportunities for beneficial change."_

A primary challenge of the next - century, decade, pick your time frame - I would say for the remainder of our time on earth, will be to uncover, encourage, and realize a potential for cities and urbanizing that can support ecosystem function. The connections with nature must be prominant and guiding, otherwise the urban species is likely to be an endangered one.  

What is the difference between an anthill and a city? I hope that going forward we begin to see cities natural processes as well as part of our nature.
