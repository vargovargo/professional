Since coming to UW in September 2012, Jason has been a unifying force for campus research, education, and action on cities. Early on, Dr. Vargo was integrated into large multi-disciplinary grant proposals to the National Science Foundation and US Environmental Protection Agency. At the same time he has continued to pursue his own research, publishing work on climate change in urban areas (link to pdf – [1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargo_JEM_2013.pdf), [2](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Climate%20change%20adaptation%20through%20urban%20heat%20management_ES&T.pdf), [3](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Stone_2014.pdf), [4](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/co-author/HabeebNaturalHazards2015.pdf), [5](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/ugec_viewpointsJuly2013_vargo.pdf)), with several related papers currently in review ([6](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargoLiuXiao_MS.pdf), [7](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/JPER_submission_5-15.pdf)). Vargo also contributed a chapter on healthy and sustainable built environments to the forthcoming book Climate Change and Public Health ([8](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/BookChapters/CC_health14_Proof.pdf)). His work touches on some of the most pressing health issues for urban populations in the US and around the globe, including how urban design can increasing physical activity ([9](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargo_JPAH_2012_689-697.pdf)) and improve traffic safety ([10](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/MMWR_cyclistDeaths_inReview.pdf)). 

Jason has personally issued calls to increase the study of cities across higher education ([11](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/Vargo_metrosapien.pdf)), and in 2014 was the first formal hire as part of UW's Livable Cities Initiative. His work on the Initiative is now building new collaborations across campus and culminated in a [Livable Cities Symposium](http://ghi.wisc.edu/symposium-adds-momentum-to-livable-cities-initiative/) in May 2015. The Symposium brought together more than 100 UW faculty and staff already working with cities to learn about colleague's work and motivate coordinated action to increase the impact of the UW to improve lives in cities. 

Moving forward, Dr. Vargo plans to initiate a formal UW program connecting cities with UW faculty and students for a year at a time. He hopes to launch the program with a pilot city in Fall 2016. The program will match city-defined projects to existing courses; creating unique and useful experiences for 100s of students and advancing sustainability in the city beyond what would have otherwise been possible. By year 5 of the program, Vargo hopes to expand the idea to other UW System campuses, including UW-Milwaukee.
