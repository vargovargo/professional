## A talk given at Bucknell on Sep 23, 2014 as part of the Understanding Place Series, hosted by the [Place Studies Program](http://www.bucknell.edu/psi)


#Outline#

In presenting the city as a place with you today I want to cover three points that can guide our discussion to follow. 

1. There are important aspects of defining the term city (and urban) that focus our attention on certain aspects of the place, but can also help us expand our understanding of them. 

2. Cities constitute our dominant habitat on this planet. Our global commitment to urban places must be acknowledged and understood to make meaningful progress on sustainability. 

3. The City simultaneously holds a unique place in our individual and collective psyches that makes them ideal spatial and political units of action on the most pressing global problems we as humans face. 

#1. Definitions#
*this comes largely from the Introduction to William Meyer's book "[The Environmental Advantages of Cities](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/environmental-advantages-cities)"*

What is a city? What is urban? 

The terms *city* and *urban* are widely used but not standaradized. In part, this may be due to the wide diversity of academic fields which study cities -- they are not the principal field of study for any subject, but are included in many. The context in which the terms are used and applied matters greatly. It is not surprising that with no standard definitions and common usage, severl misconceptions about global urbaniaztion have been able to spread. Common myths [via David Satterhwaite](http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/54031/1/63650977X.pdf):

>Urban growth will take place cheifly in megacities

>Urbanization in the less developed countries is "out of control"

> Rapidly growing cities are a phenomenon exclusively of the LDCs

For the purposes of this dicussion I would like to familiarize the audience with some of the more rigorous definitions of the terms that are used and mention some of their merits. 

###City###

> Large number of people living together in a __relatively__ small area

> High populations by themselves are not enough (ie China and India)

> High density is not even enough (!Kung Bushmen)

> High density ___AND___ large population are required

> The test of density is a __relative__ one

These three traits of a city trace back to population and density

> Chief industry other than agriculture

> Functional unity -- in place name and political identity

> "A transformation of the physical environment to a built environment."

>> "the degree to which a surface is occupied by structures and artifacts of plainly human shaping."

###Urban####

Many definitions put a place in (or out) of an urban category

> Census uses cutoffs

> UN has no standard definition

> Many statistics use a basis of incorporated local political divisions 

> Remote sensing methods are well suited to distinguish more from less urban areas on the basis of built-environment criteria

When really we would do much better to think in terms of degrees of qualities
> This implies urbaness as a continuum rather than a dichotomy

>> There are several pitfalls to using the urban-rural dichotomy

> Thus, 'City' "becomes a convenient shorthand for a place that has a high degree of urban-ness

>>In Peter Calthorpe's [Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change](http://islandpress.org/urbanism-age-climate-change) urbanism is defined by "*qualities, not quantities; by diversity, not size; by intensity, not density; by connectivity, not just location.*"

> Social, political, or cultural stereotypes associated with urban and rural have been dissvolving and should not be considered part of the term

>> Importantly, affluence shows no consistent direction in its relationship with urbaness

> Urban-ness varies between cities and regions as well as within them

>> Common terms like suburban demostrate the recognition of this as places with lower population densities, less elaborate units of government, and land cover not dominated by built structures

> The verb "*urbanize*" ought to mean move toward a higher degree of urbaness

>> This charaterizes urbanization as a process, rather than a pattern

>>> Interestingly the two charateristics operate inversely of one another

Urban-ness should be viewed as a suite of technologies that has changed over time and place. The best parts of this suite can be adopted widely and adapted to fit different contexts. 

Independent of these definitions of urban, the word carries embedded meanings that are culturally understood and which change over time. The meaning for a particular people or region will vary depending on the stage of development, the racial structure, and city history in the place. In some cases the urban advantage is dominant. This is common for many cities outside of the US, where central downtown areas exhibit the higest degree of urbanism and have high conentrations of wealth. In the US, more urban places were historically portrayed as properous, sometimes featuring billowing smokestacks on postcards marketed to tourists. Eventually the *urban penalty* of factory pollution and/or crowded tenaments changed the reputation of urban America. In many American cities, racial associaitons of denser downtowns and fringe suburbs helped fuel large-scale suburbanization and defined perceptions of 'urban' areas. 

#2. Human Commitment to Cities

The human inclination toward cities is indisputable. It is one of the most reliable trends of the last 5,000 years (population growth being the only more reliable trend). We are, today an urban species, and the city is our habitat. And though urban activities touch and shape far off places, the city is the environment that we control and construct most directly and completely. 

Some obligatory statistics on expected urban growth globally...

###Future Growth###

+ 10,000 - the number of years ago we began organizing into cities. 

+ 3.5 Billion - The number of urban residents on earth after 100 centuries of the practice

+ The amount of urbanization that took place between Mesopotamia and now will happen again by 2060

+ 5 Billion - the number of new urban residents expected in the next century (60M/yr  OR  1+M every week)

+ Combined with this urban population growth there is a tendency toward decreasing density (about half)

Given these constraints, scholars at the Marron Institute in NYC (Brandon Fuller and Paul Romer) outline two extreme paths for accomplishing the required urbanization:

1. All new urban growth is absorbed by existing cities, resulting in a 3 fold increase in population and a 6 fold increase in land area

2. 625 new cities of 10 million people *(500 for new urban residents, and 125 for people leaving existing cities looking to accomodate lower densities)*

With more than 7 billion people on the planet, cities – particularly high quality urbanism in compact population centers – present the only potential way to accommodate Earth’s population sustainably. Whether or not cities can exist without leading to catastrophic environmental degradation is an interesting question that deserves serious attention, thought, and creativity. Whether or not we should be moving to cities is not. The option of urbanism is a false choice that obstructs more useful thought on the topic. Global urbanization is not simply the product of many individual ‘decisions’ to move to cities.

Our long-term commitment to living in cities is inherent. Acknowledging this overcomes some of the biases and shortcomings currently embodied in our understanding of global urbanization by making it immediately clear that our future lies in cities. Indeed, the survival of an urban species will depend on how we live in cities and emphasizing the characteristics of cities that are most supportive of life. Using the 2008 milestone (*50%*) to discuss global urbanization gives us a touchstone for where we, as a species, are on this trajectory, but does not provide any guidance about potential actions to change it. A global urban future must move toward a richer and permanent relationship of urbanism to environmental sciences. The end result will be improved efforts toward global sustainability.

We must reconcile the fact that cities exist because of the natural world, while the existence of cities is degrading that natural world. This, at once, says cities are part of nature, and that nature is part of cities. A global urban future depends on developing truly symbiotic relationships between cities and natural environmental systems. There is a need for new theories of urbanization and settlement to incorporate connected, ‘natural’ environments and vice versa.

#3. The City as Part of our Nature

As a place -- the city is where most of us live, which is not to say that all of us live in the same place. The local character and associations we have with the city where we live help define who we are and expand the boundaries of self. And on larger scales, cities appear to be part of our human nature.

"*Cities are almost everyone's business, but no one's purview.*"

The city as a place is unique in several ways.  

First, the city is an emergent phenomenon of human social interaction. The city is a place that ceases to exist without us. Though we have city planners, few -- in not some of the most suspect -- cities were the idea a single person or even group of people. Famous city plans such as Burnham's Chicago, L'Enfant's DC, or Haussman's Paris help organize the city, not make it so in the first place. 

Second, the city is a place and is made up of places that are embraced and experienced in intimate ways. We personalize the city as our own place (picking our favorite spots of escape or finding a local haunt and making it our own). We take on the persona of our cities and see ourselves as informing it (Keep Austin Weird). And there is no limit to the number top (or bottom) 25 lists we'll click on to see how our city stacks up against others. The emotional associations people have with their city(s), could be important for stimulating local and sustained action to improve the places we live. This is something obvious in campaigns to support local businesses. 

Finally, at the same time cities affect individual identity, urbanism (in one form or another) is shared by more people than at any point in history, and this statement will be true to a new degree by the time we leave this room today. Is this the central cause of energy overuse and exploitation or can it be one of the keys to reigning in global environmental change (or at least coping with it)?  We are faced with a challenge to resolve our __domesticated tendencies__ with resource and space limits of our planet. A fundamental aim of sustainability is to preserve the existence of our species; it is clear that we will need to embrace urbanism as a human quality to achieve that end. 

With more than half of the world’s population living in cities and all urban development since those first cities expected to double by 2060, cities are now very much the dominant habitat for our species.  Our commitment to a global urban future demands that we move toward more sustainable urbanism. Accomplishing such a goal requires several important steps, all of which expand the fields of environmental and sustainability science and reinforce the value of considering urbanism. First, our relationship to urbanism should be expected to continue. Second, studies of cities and natural systems must recognize their inherent interdependencies. Finally, the local differences that make some cities healthier and ecologically supportive must be better understood. Each of these steps can generate broad research themes for new discovery. Recognizing our urban nature is a prerequisite.
