Since coming to UW in September 2012, Jason has been a unifying force for campus research, education, and action on cities. Early on, Dr. Vargo was integrated into large multi-disciplinary grant proposals to the National Science Foundation and US Environmental Protection Agency. At the same time he has continued to pursue his own research, publishing work on climate change in urban areas ([1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargo_JEM_2013.pdf), [2](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Climate%20change%20adaptation%20through%20urban%20heat%20management_ES&T.pdf), [3](http://www.urbanclimate.gatech.edu/pubs/Stone_2014.pdf), [4](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/co-author/HabeebNaturalHazards2015.pdf), [5](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/ugec_viewpointsJuly2013_vargo.pdf)), with several related papers currently in review ([6](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargoLiuXiao_MS.pdf), [7](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/JPER_submission_5-15.pdf)). Vargo also contributed a chapter on healthy and sustainable built environments to the forthcoming book Climate Change and Public Health ([8](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/BookChapters/CC_health14_Proof.pdf)). His work touches on some of the most pressing health issues for urban populations in the US and around the globe, including how urban design can increase physical activity ([9](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargo_JPAH_2012_689-697.pdf)) and improve traffic safety ([10](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/MMWR_cyclistDeaths_inReview.pdf)). 

Jason has personally issued calls to increase the study of cities across higher education ([11](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/Vargo_metrosapien.pdf)), and in 2014 was the first UW employee formally assigned to the UW's Livable Cities Initiative. His influence and effort on the Initiative is creating new collaborations across campus and recently reached new heights with the [Livable Cities Symposium](http://ghi.wisc.edu/symposium-adds-momentum-to-livable-cities-initiative/) in May 2015. The Symposium brought together more than 100 UW faculty and staff already partnering with cities to learn about colleague's work and motivate coordinated action that will increase the ability of the UW to improve lives in cities. 

Moving forward, Dr. Vargo plans to initiate a formal UW program, as part of the Livable Cities Initiative, which will connect cities with UW faculty and students for a year at a time. He hopes to launch the program with a pilot city in Fall 2016. The program will match city-defined projects to existing courses; creating unique and useful experiences for 100s of students and advancing the practice of sustainability in the city beyond what would have otherwise been possible. By year 5 of the program, Vargo hopes to expand the idea to other UW System campuses, including UW-Milwaukee.

4.  “[Rising Heat Wave Trends in Large US Cities.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/co-author/HabeebNaturalHazards2015.pdf)”  – _This works finds that in the last 50 years, the frequency, duration, intensity, and early timing of heat waves have been increasing in large US cities._
5.  “[Getting off the Island: Understanding Urban Heat in a Changing World.](https://www.academia.edu/attachments/34073324/download_file)” – _The article describes how new tools and methods can be used to improve local knowledge of urban climate hazards and inform approaches to address them._
6.  “[The Performance of the National Weather Service Heat Warning System Against Personal Weather Stations and Land Surface Temperature Imagery.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/vargoLiuXiao_2015_authorsCopy.pdf)” (2015) – _The paper demonstrates shortcomings in the National Weather Service's Heat Advisory system to address potentially hazardous local exposures to high temperatures in urban areas, and suggests ways that new data sources may improve the system to protect human health from climate change._
7.  “[The Social and Spatial Distribution of Temperature-related Health Impacts from Urban Heat Island Reduction Planning Strategies.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/first/JPER_submission_5-15.pdf)” (***in review***) - _This work found significant disparities in the effectiveness of the urban climate adaptation strategies by age, income, and race, and conclude that, to be most protective of human health, these strategies must consider population vulnerability._
8.  "[Planning Healthy and Sustainable Built Environments.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2547034/MyPapers/BookChapters/CC_health14_Proof.pdf)"(***unreleased***) – _The chapter covers ways that urban environmental design impacts health and emphasizes urbanism as a strategy for climate change mitigation with significant health co-benefits._
