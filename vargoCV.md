#Jason Vargo

___I often describe my work with two ideas.  First – city in environment – where cities/settlements sit within, and affect, surrounding 'natural environments'. The activities of the city depend on materials from the environment but also impact the quality, availability, and integrity of those environments. Second – city as environment – where the built and social settings of our daily lives influence behaviors, exposures, and relationships that determine our mental and physical health. As a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison researching connections between urbanism and public health. I have studied the impacts of the built environment on healthy behaviors as well as the impact of urbanism and local decisions on larger ecosystems. I am currently developing a campus-wide initiative that connects UW research to action for improving cities. My expertise spans scientific analysis of measured, surveyed and remotely sensed data, creative contributions to project and research design, and leadership through team building and concept development.___

<!--- 
___I have a background in urban environmental planning and public health. My focus is the impacts of urban form and planning decisions on the environment and human health. My publications cover topics such as the health effects of climate change in urban areas and the influence of urban design on routine physical activity.  My contributions to the field also include calls to increase the consideration of cities in environmental studies. These work and ideas have appeared in peer-reviewed publications, books and in popular media including Huffington Post, Scientific American, TEDx, and Smithsonian Magazine.___
